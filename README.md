## Summary 📝

Our project ambitiously aims to develop a bot for the intricate and competitive MOBA game, Dota 2. Utilizing the principles of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), we aspire to create an AI-driven bot capable of making sophisticated real-time decisions, setting new standards in AI for gaming.

## Background and Motivation 🌐

Dota 2, as a complex and strategic MOBA game, offers a unique challenge in AI and RL. The game's multifaceted environment presents numerous opportunities for AI to make real-time, strategic decisions, a scenario that is not only limited to gaming but extends to various real-world applications.

## Why This Project? 🔍

- Exploring AI's Potential: Our project is a continuation of the legacy set by OpenAI Five, pushing the boundaries of AI in strategic decision-making.
- Innovative Approach: Leveraging DQN, we aim to enhance our bot's learning process, allowing it to adapt to the dynamic nature of Dota 2.
- Real-World Applications: Success in this project could pave the way for implementing similar AI strategies in real-life scenarios demanding quick and strategic decision-making.

## Current Approaches 🔄

Current methodologies primarily involve RL and DQN for training bots to navigate Dota 2's multifaceted environment. While significant progress has been made, the quest for a bot that can match or surpass human proficiency remains open, underscoring the need for ongoing innovation.

## Project Goal 🎯

To create a Dota 2 bot that exemplifies high-level strategic play and decision-making using DQN.
